## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Fork & clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vresch/showcase.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. This project uses a git hook to enforce [conventional commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits). To install the git hook, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```sh
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install -t commit-msg
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Easily deploy your Next.js app with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) by clicking the button below:

## 📃 Scripts Overview

The following scripts are available in the `package.json`:

- `dev`: Starts the development server with colorized output
- `build`: Builds the app for production
- `start`: Starts the production server
- `lint`: Lints the code using ESLint
- `lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors
- `prettier`: Checks the code for proper formatting
- `prettier:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting issues
- `analyze`: Analyzes the bundle sizes for Client, Server and Edge environments
- `storybook`: Starts the Storybook server
- `build-storybook`: Builds the Storybook for deployment
- `test`: Runs unit and integration tests
- `e2e:headless`: Runs end-to-end tests in headless mode
- `e2e:ui`: Runs end-to-end tests with UI
- `format`: Formats the code with Prettier
- `postinstall`: Applies patches to external dependencies
- `preinstall`: Ensures the project is installed with Yarn
- `coupling-graph`: **Generates a coupling and cohesion graph for the components**

## 🔗 Coupling Graph

The `coupling-graph` script is a useful tool that helps visualize the coupling and connections between your project's internal modules. It's built using the [Madge](https://github.com/pahen/madge) library. To generate the graph, simply run the following command:

```bash
yarn coupling-graph
```

This will create a `graph.svg` file, which contains a graphical representation of the connections between your components. You can open the file with any SVG-compatible viewer.

## 🧪 Testing

This boilerplate comes with various testing setups to ensure your application's reliability and robustness.

### Running Tests

- **Unit and integration tests**: Run Jest tests using `yarn test`
- **End-to-end tests (headless mode)**: Run Playwright tests in headless mode with `yarn e2e:headless`
- **End-to-end tests (UI mode)**: Run Playwright tests with UI using `yarn e2e:ui`

## 🤖 ChatGPT Code Review

To use ChatGPT Code Review, add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with an appropriate key from the OpenAI platform.

## 💻 Environment Variables handling

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of the expected type. You’ll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at `env.mjs`. Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your project.

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    // Server variables
    SECRET_KEY: z.string(),
  },
  client: {
    // Client variables
    API_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    // Assign runtime variables
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
})
```

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```sh
  ❌ Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```
